# Getting started


## Running OpenCMISS-Iron python examples

Examples in the [OpenCMISS-examples repository](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/)  can be run by first navigating to the src/python directory of the example of interest in a terminal. The example's python script can then be directly with python as shown below for the [laplace_equation example](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/laplace_equation) :

```bash
cd src/python
python laplace_equation.py
```
