# Running from Pycharm

This section describes how we can use OpenCMISS-Iron code from the 
pycharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Preliminaries
If you are a student or a researcher, follow the link below to determine if you are eligible to sign up for a free educational license to use the Professional Edition:
    [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). This will give you access to features e.g. code profiling etc, remote debugging, interacting with dockers.

Alternatively, you can download the free Community Edition.

``` Note:: To be able to access python interpreters as remote debuggers, you will need to be using the Professional Edition of Pycharm.
```

## For a Docker installation
### Installing Pycharm

1. Install the latest version of Pycharm and install it on your host machine 
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.
