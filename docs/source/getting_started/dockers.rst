====================================

The following sections describe how to install, setup, and run OpenCMISS-Iron using Docker containers for the following development environments:

- Executing code from the terminal

- JupyterLab (only implemented when installing OpenCMISS-Iron via Docker containers)

- Pycharm

    - If you are a student or a researcher, follow the link below to determine if you are eligible to sign up for a free educational license to use the Professional Edition: [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). This will give you access to features e.g. code profiling etc, remote debugging, interacting with dockers.

    - Alternatively, you can download the free Community Edition.

.. Note::
  To be able to access python interpreters as remote debuggers within dockers using Pycharm, you will need to be using the Professional Edition of Pycharm.
